"""
Agentic Resource Discovery (ARD) support for arrstack-mcp.

Implements the *publisher* side of the ARD specification
(https://agenticresourcediscovery.org/, schema:
https://github.com/ards-project/ard-spec) so this MCP server can be *published*
and *discovered* across the agentic web. It produces discoverable metadata only:
it does not add authentication to the server, and it implements no cryptographic
``trustManifest``. A ``did:web`` host identity is emitted solely as an opt-in
(see ``build_catalog(did_web=...)``) for operators who actually control the
domain root; clients must still verify the operator before connecting.

Two documents are produced from the live server:

* ``ai-catalog.json`` — the ARD capability manifest. It is hosted at
  ``/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`` and advertises this server as a single
  ``application/mcp-server-card+json`` entry whose ``capabilities`` and
  ``representativeQueries`` let registries index it for semantic search.
* ``mcp-server-card.json`` — the MCP server card the catalog entry references
  (the "Solo Developer Path" from the spec). It lists every advertised tool
  with its ``inputSchema`` plus the connection endpoint and transport.

Everything is generated from the *enabled* tool set, so the catalog always
mirrors whatever ``ENABLED_SERVICES`` advertises. The builders are pure
functions (no I/O, no globals) so they are trivially unit-testable; ``server``
wires them into the HTTP transports and the ``--print-catalog`` CLI flag.
